\title{compute the genotype probs of a pair of full siblings with genotyping error}
\usage{
C_full_sibling_pair_gfreqs(L, G, PP, TP, GE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{L}{the number of loci}

  \item{G}{the number of genotypic states}

  \item{PP}{parent pair probs as returned by
  unrelated_pair_gfreqs() for example}

  \item{TP}{transmision probs as returned by trans_probs()}

  \item{GE}{prob of observed genotypes given true
  genotypes, as returned by
  lik_array_from_simple_geno_err() for example}
}
\description{
This could be done entirely in R, but it is hard to think it through and it seemed
it would be hard to maintain.  Super easy in C.
