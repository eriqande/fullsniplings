\title{Full-sibling inference from biallelic markers (like SNPs)}
\description{
\code{fulsniplings} is a package in development.  It implements
some new statistical perspectives and optimized computational
tools to do MCMC over the posterior distribution of pedigrees
given genetic data.

\details{
Geared toward datasets with many individuals and about 100 SNPs which are
treated as if they are unlinked. (While that is clearly false, it might be
reasonable). The name derives from the fact that the idea for the approach
taken here came to me when I was working on sibling inference issues.  It
became clear that being able to compute the posterior predictive
distribution of genotypes conditional on observed sibling groups would be a
powerful way forward in the sibling inference problem. I will eventually generalize
that to more general pedigree inference, but for now just want to implement
the easy full-sibling case as a prototypical exercise.

It really is just in development at the moment
