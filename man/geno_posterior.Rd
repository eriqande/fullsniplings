\title{given some genotype likelihoods and a prior, compute the posterior}
\usage{
geno_posterior(Lik, Pri, nStates)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Lik}{an array of genotype likelihoods.  These will
  commonly be "something by N" where N is the number of
  individuals or marriages.  In that case, the "something"
  will be all the possible genotype states in such an
  entity.  (For example 9 x L for a marriage node)}

  \item{Pri}{prior on genotypes.  I will define this
  vaguely for now.  It must, of course correspond
  strucurally to Lik.  For example, for marriages, one will
  expect it to of length 9 x L.  For individuals
  likelihoods, 3 x L, an so forth.}

  \item{nStates}{Number of genotypic states at each locus.
  So, basically, Pri should be of length nStates * L, and
  Lik should be of length nStates * L * N.  I could write a
  function that figured out what nStates was from the array
  dimensions, but I actually think this way is more
  flexible.}

\details{
This could all be done within Rcpp and would probably be faster that way, but I am
just prototyping this at the moment.
