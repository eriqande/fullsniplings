\usage{
update_marriage_posteriors_in_place(S, ML, MP, Pri, NGS, bz_idx)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{a list of lists each with two components.  The first is LMMI_Idx which is the base-0
index of the Marriage that the component is referring to, and the second is Indivs which give
the indices (base 0) of the individuals in the
full sibling groups.}

\item{PK}{per-kid marriage likelihoods.  This must be of class \code{\link{marriage_geno_lik_array}},
which is just a matrix underneath with G x G x L rows and N columns.}

\item{ML}{the marriage likelihoods matrix}

\item{MP}{the marriage posteriors matrix that is to be updated}

\item{Pri}{the join prior probbabilities of the parent pair}

\item{NGS}{Number of genotypic states.  For pairs of parents, for example, this will be 9.}

\item{bz_idx}{An integer vector holding the BASE-0 indices of the components of S that
will be accessed and used to update ML.}
}
\value{
This doesn't return anything.  It modifies ML in place via call by reference.  Our
goal here is to make updates without copying a lot of memory.
}
\description{
The intended use of this is to update the marriage posteriors after an individual has
been moved from one sibship to another.  So, for example, if you moved an individual
from sibship 40 to sibship 291 (as subscripted in R) then you would want to run this
with \code{bz_idx} equal to \code{c(39, 290)}, after you had updated the LMMFS.
