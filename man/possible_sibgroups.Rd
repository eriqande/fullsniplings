\usage{
possible_sibgroups(IFS, AFS)
}
\arguments{
\item{IFS}{the individual full siblings group vector. A vector such that element i contains the
base-0 index of the sibship to which the individual with index i belongs.}

\item{AFS}{the vector of individual indexes (base 0) that have hi sibship lod with the
focal individual.  i.e. AFS = the Acceptable Full Siblings}
}
\description{
Note that it is currently up to the user to ensure that no element of AFS exceeds the length-1
of IFS
