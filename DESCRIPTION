Description: A package to infer full-sibling relationships from genetic data.
    Geared toward datasets with many individuals and about 100 SNPs which are
    treated as if they are unlinked. (While that is clearly false, it might be
    reasonable).  I will eventually
    generalize that to more general pedigree inference, but for now just want
    to implement the easy full-sibling case as a prototypical exercise.
