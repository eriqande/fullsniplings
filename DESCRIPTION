Description: A package to infer full-sibling relationships from genetic data.
    Geared toward datasets with many individuals and about 100 SNPs which are
    treated as if they are unlinked. (While that is clearly false, it might be
    reasonable).  The name derives from the fact that the idea for the approach
    taken here came to me when I was working on sibling inference issues.  It
    became clear that being able to compute the posterior predictive
    distribution of genotypes conditional on observed sibling groups would be a
    powerful way forward in the sibling inference problem. I will eventually
    generalize that to more general pedigree inference, but for now just want
    to implement the easy full-sibling case as a prototypical exercise.
