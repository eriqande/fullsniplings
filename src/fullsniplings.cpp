//' Compute the likelihood of the genotypes of a marriage given the genotype of one of its offspring
//' 
//' It is advantageous to precompute and store some quantities for pedigree analysis with SNPs.
//' One of those quantities is the likelihood of a two parents' genotypes given the genotype 
//' of one of the offspring.  This is convenient because the likelihood of the two parents' 
//' genotypes given \emph{all} of their offspring will be the product of the single-offspring
//' likelihoods.  When genotyping error is present, that has to be thrown into the mix as well.
//' However, here we assume that the individual offspring genotype likelihoods have already been
//' computed given their observed genotypes.
//' @param offspring_likelihoods This is a 3 x L x N array of likelihoods of the individual's
//' true genotypes given their observed genotypes.  This sort of array is returned by the function
//' \code{\link{get_indiv_geno_lik}}.  
//' @param transmission_probs a 3 x 3 x 3 matrix of probs of kid genotypes given parent genotypes.
//' Such an array is returned by \code{\link{trans_probs}}.  See the documentation thereof for a
//' description.
