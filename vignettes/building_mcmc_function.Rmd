Note that to get this to really be a vignette, I must insert this at the top:
```
<!--
%\VignetteEngine{knitr::knitr}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{Building up an MCMC function}
-->
```


## Overview of what this function looks like
I am building up the functions for this in the file `mcmc1.R`.  Check that out.
